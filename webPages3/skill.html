    <td>HTML</td>
    <td>(Proficient)I have worked with HTML for seven years now. In this time I've learned to work with multiple pages, links, CSS, and even use it with multiple programming languages.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CSS</td>
    <td>(Novice)I haven't worked with CSS directly beyond basic stylesheets until recently, it's weird since I have worked with HTML for so long without fully realizing the capabilities of the stylesheet contained within.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>PHP</td>
  <td>(Novice)I have been working with PHP for a few months now, though I am still novice with it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>SQL</td>
  <td>(Proficient)I have worked with SQL for a little over half a year now. I have been getting better at it and have used it in web development classes multiple times (I don't know if you would consider this a true programming language in the classical sense).</td>
